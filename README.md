# Convert CSV to SQL: Iterates through all files in the folder 'test'

1) run > python iterate_to_txt.py
        This will count the files in test folder and save the name of each to a text file

2) run > python CSVtoSQL_LOOP.py [at first commit this isnt finished]
    this will read a file from FileDirectory.txt and write it into an SQL table in example.db


I have left some of the dev tools and test files in here.
smallTestFolder contains some examples to run this on
but the 2GB file I ran this on is in gitignore
also use unzipALL.py
